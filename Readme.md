# MIET Road To Code Introduction to C++ Programming Language 

### Roadmap  
> Absolute Beginners
* Get your basics clear. The most basic websites/sources for clearing basics regarding syntax and semantics, and general knowledge of what all tools you have available in c++, Refer:  
[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/) | [Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm) 
* You should also get your concepts clear for concepts like **pointers**, **Objected oriented programming**, **Polymorphism**, **Abstraction**, **Standard Template Library**, etc. 
* Standard template library ([STL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRVYpIET_RU)). Some Built-in Data Structures, extremely helpful in competitive Programming.

> Youtube Channels to Follow for tutorials 
1. [takeUforward](https://www.youtube.com/@takeUforward)  
2. [Love Babbar](https://www.youtube.com/@LoveBabbar) 
3. [Code Help by Love Babbar](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeHelp)
3. [Abdul Bari](https://www.youtube.com/@abdul_bari/playlists) 
5. [Detailed Concepts with Gate point of view](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJihyK0A38SZ6SdJirEdIOw): This channel is also great for your before examination binge watching. 

> Intermediate Practitioners  
These Sources are good and all that is necessary to ace coding rounds and interviews of almost all tech giants.
* [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/) This site is a collection of algorithms, their codes, concepts, slightly advanced, more oriented towards data-structures and algorithms.  
* Once familiar with basics you should try and get your hands dirty with some problem solving. You can refer various sites and sources for practicing...
* [DSA-Sheet must follow for interviews and placement](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa-sheet-by-love-babbar/)
* [Striver's DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) Strivers' DSA Sheet  
* [Geeks for Geeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?page=1&curated[]=1&sortBy=submissions&curated_names[]=SDE%20Sheet) is a great portal with built-in code runner for practicing problems. [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) is a great platform to practice for interviews and coding problems. 
* Similarly we have [interviewbit](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/). This link will take you to the complete roadmap provided by Interviewbit  

>## Coding Games and Projects:    
* [Codingame website](https://www.codingame.com/start) You can try it out in your free time
* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) You can Try out hands-on stuff; Projects and everything from here. 
* [Hands-On-Github Projects](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) You can read this repository to see if you find something interesting that you wish to build on your own. They also provide resources to learn from.

> ## Competitive Programming 
* [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/)  
* [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) 


> Solely Interest based. Not competitive, but extremely thorough, and requires a lot of prior practice. 
* [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide/) {Not suggested for beginners}... USACO is a US based coding hackathon
